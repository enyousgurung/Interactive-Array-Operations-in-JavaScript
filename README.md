# Interactive-Array-Operations-in-JavaScript

This code creates a simple webpage where you can dynamically add elements to an array and display them. The "Add" button adds the current input value to the array and alerts the user, while the "Display" button shows all elements of the array below in a structured format. It's a basic example of how JavaScript can be used to manipulate arrays and interact with user input on a webpage.
